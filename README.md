# geostrophic_turbulence

This folder will contain efforts to plot seaglider dives and transects considering along isopycnal temperature variance...this should yield horizontal energy spectra. Because of the wealth of glider transects (specifically off of the WA coast), I hope to resolve seasonality in the temperature variance spectra. The can hint at processes that set the spectra.
